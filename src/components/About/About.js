        An about us page is a specific page on your website where visitors can
        go if they want to learn more about you or your company. They can be
        called by many different names including about, about me, our story,
        mission, etc. But, the purpose is always the same: To tell website
        visitors who you are and why they should choose your business. And the
        purpose is the same whether your'e a new blogger or a giant eCommerce
        company.
